			<p>Untold is my former storytelling playground and payment experiment in digital journalism. We set out to prove that readers would pay for quality stories when given a straightforward payment method without any lock-ins or subscriptions. Something, the publishing industry is still terrified of.</p>
			<p>The reportages were trying to immerse the reader in the stories, play with new ways to present content while combining interactive modules with good storytelling.</p>
			
			<p class="center">				
				<iframe style="display: block;" src="projects/bcg/desktop_view.html" width="800" height="900" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
			</p>
			
			<p>On the plus side, we received praise for our designs and for being bold. And we worked with some talented journalists and learned why the industry is doomed. After trying a few different business models (apart from selling ads) we recognized that as a content creator we could not scale. But without being involved in the production the quality would suffer. Unfortunately, this story does not have a happy finishing.</p>
			<p>Read on. You get some eye candy, I promise.</p>

			<p>
				It started in 2014 as a quest for new income sources for journalists. Initially, we created a crowd-funding platform for stories. Acting as an intermediary and co-creating the stories at the same time, the model was flawed. It took too long to create the ambitious reportages (on top of the long funding periods). So we shifted brands and turned it into a web magazine for interactive reportages. So at least we would not announce a story before it was finished, like with the crowd-funding model.

			<h2 class="markdown-h1">Storytelling formats</h2>
			<p>Instead of just illustrating around our stories we tried to present them in a way that would not compromise the content but let the user engage with it.</p>
			<h3 class="markdown-h2">Opinion bar</h3>
			<p>In this example it was hard to give a proper stage to the context of the story. Many different protagonists, each with an opinion, a name, a face. So we created a stage, drew their faces, recorded their voices and added a little quote.

			<p>For White Lines we re-imagined how interviews are presented. Instead of long, boring sequences of question and answer we put the questions into four groups, gave them a sub-navigation and only displayed one answer at a time. The reader could click through them one by one, switch to another topic group, or easily skip the entire paragraph.</p>

			<h2 class="markdown-h1 more-top-margin">Payment experiments</h2>
			<p>The publishing industry is in a self-inflicted pickle. They ignored the internet for so long that when they realized there is not enough money to be made from advertisement, readers had already gotten used to free content everywhere. As corporate behemoths they lack the courage to run experiments and see most of them fail.</p>
			<p>That’s why we when we started thinking about how readers could pay, we let the gate open and waited who would come in. This means we created a viral paywall which accepted a Facebook share as payment. Or you could read first and pay later with Paypal. On the data side, we could run experiments with different payment flows, value propositions and presentations.</p>
			<p>Here is an example of the logo play on the paywall which gives a glimpse of what the story will be about.<br />

				What I like about this solution is that the button really serves three purposes. First, it has a disabled state and explains what to do. Then it becomes the ’Add to cart’ button. After returning to the food list it re-emerges as the basket button.

			<br />
			<p>After researching the most common web-based form builders I cringed and cried. There had to be a better way than dragging form elements from a sidebar into the form. This seems easy enough, you may say. Form design is not just about getting those pesky data inputs on the screen but alleviating some of the pain involved. And we were building a pro tool for event managers. As it turns out they use the same fields over and over, again. So why make them create customs field every time?</p>

				<li>Here is a radio button group with ’Meat. Fish. Vegetarian. Vegan.’ already included. Add more if you need to.</li>

			<p>
				It started when I was attending Startup Weekend Hamburg and our team was out of ideas what to do. After many, many rounds of bullshitting, ehm brainstorming, we were complaining about how someone gave the founder of Yo! one million to keep doing what he was doing. <br />
				We felt that for a proper conversation you’d need more than just a Yo. You need a No as well. So we spend the next day designing and building a working prototype of YONO.<br />
				Choose a user name and invite some friends via the social network of your choice. Or don’t.

				<img width="600" src="img/assets/yono_02.png" alt="YONO" />
			</div>
			<p>
				After playing with this nonsense for a couple of hours we could see the fun and addictive potential. Useless as it may seem, Yo! (or YONO for that matter) nailed the simplicity of human interaction. I am still not convinced it will stick (and that the investors haven’t wasted their money) but it is a worthwhile experiment.
