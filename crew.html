			<h2 class="markdown-h1">Digital Wallet & Pre-paid Card</h2>
			<h3 class="meta">Client: <b><a href="https://www.bcgdv.com" target="_blank">BCG Digital Ventures</a></b></h3>
			<p>Before we dive into this one let me quickly give you an overview of the project itself because the prototype I am showing here is one of the results of a months-long digital transformation project.</p>
			<p class="grey"><small>If you have never heard of digital transformation, it is a fancy term for helping big corporation lose their fear of those rebels on the internet and finally start making money online. There are good slideshares on the topic 
			<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Altimeter/slides-digital-transformation-with-brian-solis/" target="_blank">here</a> and 
			<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MFiddy/digital-transformation-and-the-customer-experience-35052981" target="_blank">here</a>. Or read what <a href="http://www.bcg.com/expertise/capabilities/technology-digital/digital.aspx" target="_blank">BCG has to say</a>.</small></p>
			
			<p>The goal of the transformation project was to find a digital interaction with money which would appeal to teens. As it turns out (at least Italian) teenagers are quite fond of cash because when they spend it all they know. The most they use digital money is on a pre-paid card. So any solution must be true to their preference and behavior.</p>
			<p>We took a stab at a digital wallet - because there are not a million of those out there already :=)
			</p>
			
			<h3>Here is why it is actually a good idea</h3>
			<p>The wallet was designed to be an extension of the pre-paid card. This means it is connected to it and displays exactly the amount left on the card. So far nothing special, right?<br />
			Usually, pre-paid cards can be charged at an ATM or via bank transfer. We added a way to send money to friends who also use the app. Any charge is immediately shown in the app.
			</p>

			</p>
			
			<h3>Another Way To Save Money</h3>
			<p>Saving money for the next small or big purchase is something teens do all the time. Whether it is a new Playstation or putting a few bucks aside for next weekend. We learned that they still use shoeboxes for bigger savings. So we replicated the way saving money in boxes works.</p>
			<p>First, a savings box is different from pocket money.<br />
			Second, we have to protect the box from being looted before it is due. This can either be a lock which only opens when enough money has been saved. Or a time lock, e.g. a vacation savings box would not open before summer.
			</p>
			<p>There were crazier ideas what to do with these boxes but I am only gonna name two. An S.O.S. box which could be opened remotely by the parents (for example when the kid was on vacation) and branded boxes for coupons or games.</p>

			<p>
				What I like about this solution is that the button really serves three purposes. First, it has a disabled state and explains what to do. Then it becomes the ’Add to cart’ button. After returning to the food list it re-emerges as the basket button.

			<p>
				We ran a couple of experiments to find a balance between fancy animations and predictability. The navigation bar up top seemed like a good place to use for elements like the search bar, category names and filters.

			</div>
			<br />
			<p>After researching the most common web-based form builders I cringed and cried. There had to be a better way than dragging form elements from a sidebar into the form. This seems easy enough, you may say. Form design is not just about getting those pesky data inputs on the screen but alleviating some of the pain involved. And we were building a pro tool for event managers. As it turns out they use the same fields over and over, again. So why make them create customs field every time?</p>
			<ul class="markdown-ul projects">
				<li>Need a membership number?</li>
				<li>Cool. Here is a text input field with a label called ’Membership No.’</li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="markdown-ul projects">
				<li>Meal choice, anyone?</li>
				<li>Here is a radio button group with ’Meat. Fish. Vegetarian. Vegan.’ already included. Add more if you need to.</li>

			<h2 class="markdown-h1">Future Of Shopping Concept</h2>
			<h3 class="meta">Agency: <b>Scholz & Friends</b></h3>
			<h3 class="meta">Client: <b>Penny Supermarket</b></h3>
			<p>For this project the client was asked to do a website overhaul and deliver a new shopping concept. So we focused our energy on the discount shopper’s best friend, the leaflet.</p>
			<p>We designed a digital leaflet with a shopping list which syncs to a mobile app. The ’add to shopping list’ functionality is baked into each item, works well when they run specials and comes with a bulk action in the recipe finder (more on this later).
			</p>

				<img class="midWidth" src="img/assets/portfolio_penny_01.png" alt="" />
			</div>
			<p class="caption">Shopping list</p>
			<br />
			<p>It was important that whatever functionality the app has, there had to be a physical counterpart. So all digital functionality was designed as an extension to the printed leaflet rather than a closed world.</p>
			<h3 class="markdown-h2">Gaming For Kids</h3>
			<p>For the next part, we combined two fancy pancy buzzwords into one delicious dish: augmented reality shopping gamification. Has your head exploded already?<br />
			Take a look. It’s less awful than it sounds.

				<p class="caption">[01] iPad game for kids &nbsp; &nbsp;   [02] Augmented reality version</p>
			</div>
			<p>The supermarket created a pack of stuffed animals. The kids love them. So we pondered over how to make them into a virtual experience. The first that came to mind was a game to earn credits for the toys. <br />
			To have a bit more real-life interaction we wanted to play hide and seek with the animals. While being in the store the kids could run around, find the hidden animals and annoy the hell out of the parents :=)</p>
			<br />
			<h3 class="markdown-h2">Shop Localization</h3>
			<p>Per default, the homepage featured a localization search bar below the logo. After users find their home market, the entire product stage would receive a personalization by city and, if applicable, even down to special offers by individual markets.
			</p>
			<div class="fullWidth center more-top-margin">
				<img class="midWidth" src="img/assets/portfolio_penny_05.png" alt="" />
			</div>
			<p class="caption">Localized store concept with custom stage</p>
			<br />
			<h3 class="markdown-h2">Recipe Finder</h3>
			<p>The way discounters work is they have a new assortment every week plus a permanent set of basic articles. The recipe finder had to reflect a mix of store brands and local specials. When we feature a recipe based on weekly specials, the week after you might have to shop for some of the items somewhere else because they are out of stock at a discounter. This either means not to keep an archive or making all recipes super-basic. Or not giving a shit and just providing a couple of recipes as a way to bind customers. Either way, for an app by a single chain to find a modicum of use as a helper in daily shopping and planning, it has to be extremely well-balanced. <br />
			Most of those apps fall short of making users happier than their un-branded, general purpose adversaries. A simple list app like <a href="https://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/" target="_blank">Clear</a> is probably the better choice when all you need is a list of things to get. I even find myself trying the shopping lists in recipe apps because I see the benefit in not having to write down every ingredient. But when I only want to note down a few thins to get, it’s list-mode rather than recipe-mode. And lists mean Clear. Before I have my shopping list splattered over two or more apps I’ll rather keep one Clear list where I have most products I need and I cross out what I don’t need but never delete it. So the ones to buy are stacked on top and below are crossed-out items.
